Create a Markdown file named "medidas.md" that will serve as the base design guideline for the project.

It should include sections to define:

1. Logo sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)  
2. Max width and padding of containers  
3. Borders and border radius  
4. Vertical and horizontal margins per device  
5. Padding for text content (paragraphs and headings)  
6. Color palette (primary, secondary, background, text, borders)  
7. Typography (fonts, sizes for H1â€“H6 and base text)  
8. Content and icon alignment rules  
9. Image behavior and dimensions  
10. Header dimensions (height, padding, border thickness, etc.)

This file will be used to apply layout and spacing rules consistently and symmetrically across the entire page.

When invoked, you must ask me whether the defined changes should be applied globally or only to a specific section before implementing them.

If any value inside "medidas.md" is changed or updated, you must automatically read and reflect those changes in the layout, but always confirm with me before applying them.
