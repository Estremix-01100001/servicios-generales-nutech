Do not delete images or modify text unless you indicate it.

2. Design and Aesthetics

Respect:

The original project color palette.

Borders, horizontal and vertical margins.

Spacing between sections.

Alignment with the main page icon.

New sections must visually adapt to existing ones.

If changes affect multiple sections or the entire page, user confirmation must be requested before applying.

5. Coding Best Practices

Write clean, modular code without style conflicts.

Remove unused code without affecting functionality.

6. Problem Solving

If the same issue occurs more than 3 times, review global styles and architecture to find a root solution.

7. Active User Interaction

Ask questions if context is missing.

Do not implement any assumptions without user confirmation.

8. Optimization and Security

Optimize images (lightweight formats, lazy loading).

Apply basic security measures where applicable.

Work in blocks of 5 tasks at a time.

Inform if anything is missing or if progress cannot continue without more data.

Implement a minimal design guide including:

Typography

Forms must have basic validations (required fields, valid email, etc.).

Consider basic security measures to avoid dangerous inputs if there is a backend.
